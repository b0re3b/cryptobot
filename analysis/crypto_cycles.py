Crypto Cycles Analysis Module

This module provides tools for analyzing cyclical patterns in cryptocurrency markets,
including Bitcoin halving cycles, market sentiment cycles, and other periodic patterns
that can be used for predictive modeling.

It integrates with time series models and market data processors to identify,
quantify, and forecast based on cyclical components in cryptocurrency price data.
